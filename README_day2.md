Day 2: RESTful Design & Routes 
For Day 2 of the GDGoC Bowen 30-Day Challenge


I understod Endpoint/ Routes and also used the GET method

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Sample Response |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/` | GET | Root/Welcome | `{"message": "Welcome to my Day 2 API!", "message2" : "Welcome to Day 2 of GDGOC 30 Days Challenge }` |
| `/about` | GET | Challenge Info | `{"user": "Developer", "day": 2, ...}` |
| `/status` | GET | Health Check | `{"status": "up"}` |
